<head>History of the <rs type="ethnic">Songai</rs> kings of the <roleName>shî</roleName> dynasty and especially of <persName><roleName>shî</roleName> Ali</persName>.</head>
<p>It is now time for us to return to our subject, which is the biography of the askia. We have dwelt on all these characters1, thus following a path which it was not in our designs to follow; there was indeed no result to be obtained from it, since it is almost certainly the case that the major part of the preceding accounts is fictitious. We ask God the Most High for his forgiveness.
Lord, be praised and glorified! I declare that there is no other god but you, I ask your forgiveness and return to you.</p>

<p>After the <roleName>shî</roleName> <persName>Bâro-Dal-Yombo</persName>2 reigned the <persName><roleName>shî</roleName> Mâdogo</persName>3, then the <persName><roleName>shî</roleName> Mohammed-Koûkiya</persName>, then the <persName><roleName>shî</roleName> Mohammed-Fâri</persName>, then the <persName><roleName>shî</roleName> Balma</persName>, then the <persName><roleName>shî</roleName> Souleïmân-Dâma</persName>5, who, according to some versions, was called Dândi.
The latter was the ancestor of the inhabitants of the city of <placeName>Arham</placeName>.6

This is the dynastic title that the <title>Tarikh es-Soudân</title> spells <foreign>sonni</foreign> and of which the variants <foreign>soun</foreign>, <foreign>sin</foreign>, <foreign>tyin</foreign>, etc., are found. The dynasty of the <roleName>shî</roleName> or <roleName>sonni</roleName>, descended from that of the <foreign>diâ</foreign> or <foreign>zâ</foreign> which had preceded it, reigned in <placeName>Gâo</placeName> from 1335 to 1493. It seems, from the testimony of <persName>Leo the African</persName>, that these two dynasties were of Berber origin; Marmol and Barth shared this opinion.</note>

It was he who defeated the people of the province of <placeName>Mîma</placeName>1, sacked their territory (<ref target="arpage43"/>) and annihilated their power. Previously this province formed a great kingdom, of formidable power, which had broken away from the empire of <placeName>Malli</placeName>. There were in the <placeName>Mîma</placeName> twelve great chiefs, of whom the principal was the <persName>Mîma-kono</persName>2. Among the other princes of the <placeName>Mîma</placeName> was the <persName>Toukifiri-sôma</persName>3; before him the king of the
<placeName>Mâssina</placeName> had to stand and cover himself with dust as he swore loyalty to him and took off his boubou4 and then draped himself in it; traces of his capital, ruined today, can still be seen. The title of this prince has continued to the present day, but he who now bears it has fallen away and is obliged to go on foot, having no mount; his authority has disappeared, but his title has remained (praise be to the eternal Sovereign!). The king of <placeName>Mâssina</placeName> goes to visit this personage still, claiming that it brings him good luck; he consults him and asks him to pray for him; he dismounts his mount to greet him and goes to find him in the place where his now ruined capital once stood.</p>

<p>
The successor of <persName>Silmân-Dâma</persName> was the tyrant, the debauchee, the accursed, the oppressor, the <persName><roleName>shî</roleName> Ali</persName>5, the last king of this

None of his armies was ever routed: always victorious, never defeated. He left no region, no town, no village, from the land of <placeName>Kanta</placeName>1 to <placeName>Sibiridougou</placeName>, without attacking it
at the head of his cavalry, warring against the inhabitants and ravaging their territory.</p>

<p>The meaning of this word <roleName>shî</roleName> is thus given, according to a text which I have seen, written in the hand of <persName>Mahmûd</persName>,2 one of our imâms:

The <persName><roleName>shî</roleName> Ali</persName> was a tyrannical king, so hard-hearted that he sometimes had a child thrown into a mortar and forced the mother to pound it, the latter having to pound her child while it was still alive; the flesh was then fed to the horses. He was debauched and impious, so much so that one of the sheikhs of his time, inhabiting <placeName>Môri-Koïra</placeName>, was asked whether this prince was a Muslim or an infidel, his actions being those of an infidel although he pronounced the double profession of Muslim faith and spoke as one well versed in the things of religion.</p>


<p>See, from his deeds, what his impiety was: he had jurisconsults put to death! And how many villages he destroyed, causing their inhabitants to perish in the flames! He inflicted

In sum, his acts of cruelty and his disastrous administrative procedures were so numerous that this volume would not be sufficient to enumerate them.</p>

Tarikh es-Soudan, translation, pp. 258-261). <persName>Mahmûd Kâti</persName> had been dead for about a month at that time.

The people of his time and his soldiers had given him the nickname of <addName>Dâli</addName> as an honorary title and whenever he called out to someone, they would reply, <quote><addName>Dâli</addName> !</quote> One of our friends, <persName>Mohammed <rs type="ethnic">Wangara</rs> ben Abdallah ben Sandioûka El-Foulâni</persName>1 (God have mercy on him!) told me that he had heard it said by <persName>Aboulabbâs Sîdi Ahmed ben Anda-ag-Mohammed</persName> (God have mercy on him! ): <quote>It is not lawful to give such a nickname to anyone, for this word means <gloss>the most high</gloss>2 and must be reserved for the Master of all power, who is God the most high.</quote> The same is true of <foreign>Doûlinta</foreign> those who say <foreign>Doûrinta</foreign> commit a fault - an expression which means <gloss>the slave of the Master</gloss>3: now, by "Master" who used this expression meant the chî4 (the curse of God (<ref target="arpage45"/>) be upon him!). As for this term <foreign>Dâli</foreign>, it is used today only when addressing the <roleName><placeName>Koûma</placeName>-koï</roleName>5 and the <roleName><placeName>Dienné</placeName>-koï</roleName>.

<note n="4">The author probably means that the slaves or servants of the <roleName>shî</roleName> were given the appellation of slaves of the Master, which amounted to conferring on the <roleName>shî</roleName> a title that belongs only to God, such as that of <quote>Most High</quote>.</note>

<p>This <roleName>shî</roleName> spent his entire reign in warlike expeditions: he had royal residences at <placeName>Koûkiya</placeName>1, at <placeName>Gâo</placeName> and at <placeName>Kabara</placeName>2; the latter was called <placeName>Tila</placeName>; he had yet another at <placeName>Wara</placeName><ref target="p.104n4"/>in the province of <placeName>Dirma</placeName>5: this one was in the vicinity of the city of <placeName>Ankaba</placeName>6 and faced the city of <placeName>Diendiao</placeName>7; but he did not stay in any of them. The <roleName>shî</roleName> who had preceded him resided in <placeName>Koûkiya</placeName>, but the <persName><roleName>shî</roleName> Ali</persName>, this scoundrel, was constantly on expeditions.</p>

<p>At the beginning of his reign, he had gone to the city of <placeName>Dîreï</placeName>8.  Then, having had news of the king of <rs type="ethnic">the Môssi</rs> named <persName><persName>Komdâo</persName></persName>9, he left <placeName>Dîreï</placeName> to put himself in a position to meet him,

-- The <persName><roleName>shî</roleName> Ali</persName> having then left <placeName>Dîrei</placeName>, the two adversaries met at <placeName>Kobi</placeName>1.</p>

<p>
It was in the year 873 that the city of <placeName>Timbuktu</placeName> was sacked by <persName><roleName>shî</roleName> Ali</persName>, who entered it on the fourth day of the month of redjeb (18 January 1469).

<note n="1">If we count the number of times that the month of Ramadan recurred from the advent of the <persName><roleName>shî</roleName> Ali</persName> until the time of his presence in <placeName>Sâma</placeName>, we find that thirteen to fourteen lunar years elapsed between these two periods;
the coming of the prince having taken place in the year 869 of the hegira, it is therefore appropriate to place his presence in Sâma in the year 882-883, i.e. from 1477 to 1479 of our era. This is quite consistent with the indications of the <title>Tarikh es-Soudân</title>, which places the arrival of the <roleName><rs type="ethnic">Môssi</rs> emperor</roleName> at <placeName>Sâma</placeName> in 1477 and at <placeName>Bîrou</placeName> (<placeName>Walata</placeName>) in 1480, and then places the battle of <placeName>Kobi</placeName> in 1483. There are ambiguities and contradictions in the above account, which may be due to the fact that one part of the account was written by the grandson while the other was borrowed from the work of his grandfather. Thus, he relates the affair of <placeName>Kobi</placeName> twice, seeming to place it first at the beginning of the reign of <persName><roleName>shî</roleName> Ali</persName> and before the expedition of <rs type="ethnic">the Môssi</rs> to <placeName>Walata</placeName>, only to place it some fifteen years later; it is possible that, with regard to the stay that the <roleName>shî</roleName> made in <placeName>Dîreï</placeName> at the beginning of his reign, the author had anticipated the events by telling that it was from this locality that the prince was later to leave to go to <placeName>Kobi</placeName> to meetthe <roleName>emperor of <rs type="ethnic">the Môssi</rs></roleName>. As for the present paragraph, it should probably be interpreted as follows: <rs type="ethnic">the Môssi</rs> marched on <placeName>Walata</placeName>, having left the baggage and family of their chief in <placeName>Dîreï</placeName>; the <persName><roleName>shî</roleName> Ali</persName>, who was in 
<placeName type="region">the Niger buckle</placeName>, set out on their tracks, arrived in the <rs type="ethnic">Bambara</rs> countries after their passage, put to death the chief of <placeName>Sila</placeName> to punish him for not having stopped them, then, having given up reaching them, went to <placeName>Dîreï</placeName> and seized the luggage and the household of their chief; the latter, during that time, had attacked and plundered <placeName>Walata</placeName> and returned to his country; on arriving near the <placeName type="river">Niger</placeName>, he learned that the <roleName>shî</roleName> had seized his goods and his family, marched to meet him, was taken by fear when he saw his numerous army and resumed his march towards the south-east without pushing on to <placeName>Dîreï</placeName>; it is then that the <roleName>shî</roleName>, taking advantage of the disarray of his adversary, set out in pursuit and reached him at <placeName>Kobi</placeName>.

Some did not even take supper with them that night, others did not take blankets to sleep on; some left on foot although they had horses in their houses, but they left them there for fear that the time to saddle them would delay them.

As for me, I hardly believe that such a thing was possible and I do not think that <persName>El-Haddjâdj ben Yoûssof</persName>1, in spite of his ardour to shed blood and his cruelty towards all, ever did anything similar to what was then done in <placeName>Timbuktu</placeName> nor that he saw his orders so punctually executed.</p>

The ferocity of <persName><roleName>shî</roleName> Ali</persName> towards the Muslims and his cruelty in all circumstances, whether it was a question of worldly things or those of religion, had become such that the courts were overflowing with sadness and concern. People despaired of ever achieving deliverance, for his reign had lasted so long that they had lost all hope of the day when these evils would cease and end. However, this day came at last, thanks to a poor holy man, whose daughter had been stolen by the king.</p>

<p>This unfortunate man came to the prince's house to explain his grievances, and the prince swore that he would have him thrown into the fire if he did not leave his presence immediately.

<p>
One of these ministers, the Dirma-koë of whom we have just spoken, swore that he would not fail to kill the scholar Sâlih Diawara, an envoy of the askia prince, adding: "If you do not have this scholar put to death, the askia will not cease to dispatch envoys to you; if, on the contrary, you have him put to death, the askia will not continue to to send them to you". But God prevented him from carrying out this plan and the <roleName>shî</roleName>, addressing himself to Sâlih Diawara, said to him: "Return to the one who sent you; but, if a new messenger comes to me on his behalf, let the blood of this messenger fall on your head. Tell the askia who sent you that he should prepare himself for the fight that is going to take place between him and me; tell him that I do not accept his proposals and that I will never accept them."</p>

<p>
The scholar Sâlih Diawara returned to the prince, reported to him the words of the <roleName>shî</roleName> <persName>Bâro</persName> and made known to him the dispositions of spirit of the latter and the energy with which the <roleName>shî</roleName> had refused before him to embrace Islamism.
When Sâlih Diawara had informed the askia of what he had witnessed during his meeting with the <roleName>shî</roleName> <persName>Bâro</persName>, the prince gathered his council, composed of the ulama, the notables and the chiefs of his army, and he consulted them on the point of knowing what he should do: to engage in the fight with the <roleName>shî</roleName> <persName>Bâro</persName> or to send him a third envoy? All were of the opinion that he should send a third envoy who, by using diplomacy, would try to soften the <roleName>shî</roleName>; perhaps then God would bring this one back to the right way and make him embrace Islam.</p>

<p>It was then that the askia sent me, the humble believer, the  <roleName>alfa</roleName> Kâti, to the <roleName>shî</roleName>. So I went to him and found him in the town of Anfao, which is near Gâo. I gave him the message of the askia, prince of the believers, and I spoke to him with as much courtesy as possible, as the askia <persName><roleName>El-Hâdj</roleName> Mohammed</persName>, prince of the believers, had recommended to me. I spoke kindly to him in the hope that God would bring him back to the right path. But he refused to listen to my advice, became angry, ordered the drum to be beaten immediately and began to gather his troops, scolding and storming in order to intimidate me, while I applied to myself the words of the poet: "I will ensure today by my death the triumph over the cross and its worshippers".</p>

<p>
At the same time, his troops massed around him like a mountain range (<ref target="arpage55"/>), raising clouds of dust that made the day seem like night, and began to shout loudly, swearing that blood would flow freely.</p>

<p>Then I returned and told him what had happened. The askia <persName><roleName>El-Hâdj</roleName> Mohammed</persName>, prince of the believers, immediately made his preparations, ordering the drum to be beaten and his troops to gather around him immediately. All his men swore to remain faithful to him until death.</p>

<p>Then he mounted his horse and, at the head of his victorious army, rode in the direction of <roleName>shî</roleName> Bảro. The two troops met on Monday, the 24th of the month of Jomâda II. Between the time when the askia, prince of the believers, had sent his [first] message to the <roleName>shî</roleName> Bảro and the time of

the meeting of their two armies, fifty-two days had passed.
</p>


<p>A violent battle ensued between the two troops. God came to the aid of the askia against the <roleName>shî</roleName> <persName>Bâro</persName>, whose soldiers were routed and suffered such terrible losses that they believed that they were all going to perish and that the end of the world
had arrived. <persName><roleName>The Dendi-fâri</roleName> Afoumba</persName>, who was next to the <roleName>shî</roleName> <persName>Bâro</persName> and who was a very brave man, threw himself that day into the River, where he died.</p>

<p>As for <persName><roleName>El-Hâdj</roleName> Mohammed</persName>, he had with him the <persName><roleName>mansa</roleName> Kûra</persName>, son of the <persName><roleName>mansa</roleName> Mûsa</persName>, of which it was spoken before, but he was accompanied by none of the other kings of Tekroûr nor of Songaï, none having answered his call
except for this one.</p>

<p>When God had routed the troops of <roleName>shî</roleName> <persName>Bâro</persName>, he fled alone to Ayorou1, where he remained until his death, while the very fortunate, the very orthodox2 seized power and became the prince of the believers and the khalifa of the Muslims.</p>

<p>
Thus God made the askia <persName><roleName>El-Hâdj</roleName> Mohammed</persName> inherit all the territory of the <persName>Bâro</persName> <roleName>shî</roleName>, a territory which extended from <placeName>Kanta</placeName> to <placeName>Sibiridougou</placeName>3, and this prince found himself becoming the master of twenty-four tribes which consisted of slaves of the <roleName>shî</roleName> and not of free men reduced to slavery.4</p>

<p>We shall enumerate, God willing, the names of these tribes. Three of them were among the pagan tribes of the Bambara. The first was related to the descendants of Diara Koré Boukar, while the second had its origin in Ngaratibi1 and the third came from Kassambara. (<persName>The <roleName>shî</roleName> Bâro</persName> had inherited these tribes from his father the <persName><roleName>shî</roleName>
Ali</persName>, who had inherited them in the same way from the <persName><roleName>shî</roleName> Souleïmân-Dâma</persName>,
to whom some give the name of <persName>Dândi</persName>. In the same way the latter had inherited them from the <roleName>shî</roleName> Balma, this one from the <persName><roleName>shî</roleName> Mohammed-Fâri</persName>, this one from the <persName><roleName>shî</roleName> Mohammed-Koûkiya</persName>: In the same way the latter had inherited them from the <roleName>shî</roleName> Mâdogo, who, himself, had seized them on the <roleName><placeName>Malli</placeName>-koï</roleName> .</p>

<p>These tribes in fact had become vassals of the <roleName><placeName>Malli</placeName>-koï</roleName> at the time when the ancestors of the latter had increased their power and after having held the [first] <roleName><placeName>Malli</placeName>-koï</roleName> themselves under their authority. Later, God having brought down the power of the <roleName><placeName>Malli</placeName>-koï</roleName> to the benefit of the <roleName>shî</roleName> Mâdogo, the latter ravaged the empire of the <roleName><placeName>Malli</placeName>-koï</roleName>, took their children into captivity, seized all their property, and took away from them the property of these twenty-four tribes.</p>

<p>As for the (<ref target="arpage56"/>) three of these tribes (of which we have spoken above), they were among the domestic serfs of the <roleName><placeName>Malli</placeName>-koï</roleName>. Since they belonged to the <roleName><placeName>Malli</placeName>-koï</roleName>, the custom was that none of the men of these tribes could marry until the king had given 40,000

<p>These three tribes in question descended from a common primitive stock, [their ancestors] having had the same father, called Béma Tâsso, and the same mother, named Arbaa Kalé, so that they were all three brothers of father and mother. A quarrel broke out between them about a woman that all three wanted to marry, and they came to hate each other so much that they ceased to consider themselves of the same blood. They derived their origin from <placeName>Kassambara</placeName> and their village, which was called <placeName>Niani</placeName>, was part of the territory of the <placeName>Malli</placeName> and was the capital of the <roleName><placeName>Malli</placeName>-koï</roleName>.2</p>

<p>
From the time of the <roleName><placeName>Malli</placeName>-koï</roleName>, and since these tribes belonged to them, they were bound to an annual payment of forty cubits [of land to be developed] by each couple, husband and wife; so it was until these tribes had passed into the hand of the <roleName>shî</roleName>. In the time of the <roleName>shî</roleName>, from the first of these rulers who was their master until the last, that is to say, until the <persName><roleName>shî</roleName> Ali</persName>, the service was thus regulated: the people were gathered together in groups of a hundred, men and women together, and the <roleName>shî</roleName> made each group measure two hundred cubits on the ground; the people then gathered to the sound of drums and flutes and ploughed the land for him, shouting in the manner of ploughmen while the drums were beaten; when the time of harvest came, the produce of these fields was divided by the <roleName>shî</roleName> among his

soldiers, and, if the harvest was nil, he struck the people with an imposition and made them responsible for it.</p>

<p>When the <persName><roleName>askia</roleName> Muhammad</persName> had become the master of these tribes, he fixed the benefit thus: every year, at harvest time, he sent a man from his entourage to collect the produce of the harvest; if anyone was able to give ten measures of flour1, they took it from him; if anyone could give twenty measures, they took it from him, and so on up to thirty measures, without exceeding this figure, which was the limit that was never crossed, even if the taxpayer would have been able to provide a thousand measures. <persName><roleName>The askia</roleName> Mohammed</persName> also took from these people some of their children and used them to buy horses.2</p>

<p>As for the fourth of the twenty-four tribes of which we have spoken, it was the tribe of the people called <rs type="ethnic">Tyindikèta</rs> (<ref target="arpage57"/>), from a word which, in their language, means <gloss>cutter of grass</gloss>.3 Their work, from the time of the <roleName><placeName>Malli</placeName>-koï</roleName> until the time of the <roleName>shî</roleName>, consisted in cutting grass for the horses. When they passed into the hands of the <persName><roleName>askia</roleName> Mohammed</persName>, the latter maintained this custom, for he found that they were good only for tending horses. However the <persName><roleName>askia</roleName> Mohammed</persName> imposed a new obligation on them, enjoining the adults to make dugouts which the young boys employed as grooms would make use of for the service of the horses.4 <persName><roleName>The askia</roleName> Mohammed</persName> did indeed take from this tribe a number of young boys to whom he had his horses groomed, wherever he found them from <placeName>Gâo</placeName> to <placeName>Sibiridougou</placeName>.</p>

<p>The fifth tribe was <rs type="ethnic">the Zendji</rs>1.

<p>Whenever anyone came to the prince to ask for a boat, he provided it by taking from the people of that tribe a dugout canoe with its crew.</p>


<p><persName><roleName>The askia</roleName> Mohammed</persName> in fact had taken and reserved these people for his service and that of the people of his house, not allowing anyone to employ them or sell them. He reserved this right for himself and his children, but made an exception for the <persName><rs type="ethnic">Hasanid</rs> <roleName>sheriff</roleName> Es-Seqli</persName>, who was a descendant of <persName>Ali</persName>. When this sheriff went to <placeName>Gâo</placeName> and found the <persName><roleName>askia</roleName> Muhammad</persName> there, the latter gave him all the descendants of a <rs type="ethnic">Zendji</rs> called <persName>Faran-Taka</persName>2, who were at that time 2,700 in number.3 The prince made this gift to the sheriff because he belonged to the descendants of the Prophet (God shower his blessings on him and grant him salvation!) and to show his affection for him. In the biography of the <persName><roleName>askia</roleName> Mohammed</persName>, we will talk in detail, God willing, about

this liberality, as well as of the division of the Zendji which were attributed partly to this sheriff and partly to other characters.</p>

<p>The sixth tribe consisted of the people called Arbi1. These provided the servants of the prince, the members of his household and his servants; their daughters were employed in the service of his wives. They also farmed for him and his children. The young men of the tribe escorted him in arms, marching before and behind him in war as in ordinary times; he employed them as messengers for his special missions. The people of this tribe were exclusively attached to the service of the prince and that is why they were not required to pay royalties in kind.</p>

<p>As for the seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth and eleventh tribes, which were tribes of blacksmiths, they were the tribes of the Diam-Téné, the Diam-Wali, the Sorobanna, [of the Komé] and of the Samatséko. These five tribes were all descended from the same father. This father was a blacksmith, (<ref target="arpage58"/>) a slave of the Christians, who had fled from the islands of the Atlantic Ocean and had come to <placeName>Koûkiya</placeName>, capital of the <roleName>shî</roleName>, at the time of the <roleName>shî</roleName> Mohammed-Fâri. This slave, whose name was Boukar, married a slave of Nâna-Salam, mother of the aforementioned <roleName>shî</roleName>. This slave, who was called Matabala, gave him five male children: Téné, who was the father of the Diam-Téné tribe; Wali, who was the father of the Diam-Wali tribe; Sorobanna, who was the father of the Sorobanna tribe; Komé, who was the father of the Komé tribe, and Samatséko, who was the father of the Samatséko tribe, these tribes attaching their genealogies to their fathers.3</p>

<p>The father of these five children was a cruel, rude, depraved, authoritarian, ignorant, tyrannical and violent man.
He and his sons engaged in robbery, cutting off roads, murdering people, taking them prisoner or robbing them. Complaints about them were brought to the then reigning <roleName>shî</roleName>, who sent a small troop against them with the order to kill the father and seize the children, the latter being his slaves since they were the sons of one of his slaves. The father was killed and the five sons were brought to the <roleName>shî</roleName>, who distributed them among different cities to prevent them from meeting again and repeating their misdeeds. Each of them had numerous descendents.</p>

<p>The dues of these five tribes, from the time of the <roleName>shî</roleName> until the time of the <persName><roleName>askia</roleName> Muhammad</persName>, were one hundred spears and one hundred arrows per each family per year.</p>

<p>As for the twelfth tribe, which was that of the Kurunkoi4 that one meets from <placeName>Gâo</placeName> to the city of Fâni2, it originated in the country of Sôma , which borders their [present] territory
 without being however very close to it4.  It is an offshoot of the Samatséko tribe, because it descends from the sons of the daughter of Samatséko.</p>

<p>His father's nickname was Arloûm and he belonged to the clan of the Silla1 which is said to have originated from Tôro2.

We have seen people who trace his mother's genealogy back to the descendants of Djâbir ben Abdallah, one of the Ansâr, but it would be out of place to go into further details on this subject3.</p>

<p>
It is impossible to enumerate his virtues and qualities, such as his excellent policy, his benevolence towards his subjects and his concern for the poor. There is no one like him among those who preceded him, nor among those who came after him. He had a great affection for the Ulema, the holy people and the tâlebs. He

 used to give a lot of alms and perform, in addition to the prescribed duties, supererogatory acts of devotion. He was a most intelligent and wise man. He was very considerate of the Ulema and gave them slaves and wealth generously in order to secure the interests of the Muslims and to help them in their submission to God and in the practice of worship. He did away with all that the shîs had introduced in the way of blameworthy innovations, iniquities and bloody cruelties. He established the religion on the most solid foundations. He freed from slavery all those who could claim their rights to freedom and returned to their owners all the property of which the shî had robbed them. He restored the religion by instituting câdis and imâms: may God reward him for his zeal in the name of Islamism!
Thus he appointed a <roleName>câdi</roleName> in <placeName>Timbuktu</placeName>, a <roleName>câdi</roleName> in the town of <placeName>Dienné</placeName> and a <roleName>câdi</roleName> in every town in his territory that had one, from the <placeName>Kanta</placeName> to <placeName>Sibiridougou</placeName>.</p>

<p>
Having disembarked one day in the town of Kabara, as he was heading <ref/> at the head of his troops towards the Soûra-Bantamba, he mounted his horse preceded by his servant Ali Foulan who carried his sword, and left after the prayer of the sunset, having with him nobody other than this Ali Foulan. When he arrived at the place where the people of <placeName>Tombouctou</placeName> make the prayer today on feast days, he said to Ali Foulan, "Do you know where the house of the <roleName>câdi</roleName> Mahmoud ben Omar is?" - "Certainly," replied Ali. - "Go then to the house of this <roleName>câdi</roleName>," resumed the askia, "and tell him that I am here alone and that he should come and join me there alone." Then he held his horse by tightening the reins and Ali Foulan left.</p>

<p>
The latter found the sheikh, that is the <roleName>câdi</roleName> Mahmoûd, stationed at the door of his house and surrounded, as usual, by a number of people. Ali Foulan

transmitted to him the message of the <persName><roleName>askia</roleName> Mohammed</persName> and the <roleName>câdi</roleName>, deferring to the invitation, only went home to take his staff and set out with Ali, dismissing all those who wanted to follow him, to go alone to the askia Mohammed. Arrived near this one, he greeted him and kissed his generous hands. Ali Foulan seized the horse's noseband and took it away, after having received the prince's order to keep away all the indiscreet.</p>

<p>Then the askia said to the <roleName>câdi</roleName>, after the complete exchange of polite formulas and greetings: "I had sent messengers bearing my instructions: did you fulfill my orders in <placeName>Tombouctou</placeName>? No, you sent my messengers away, preventing them from carrying out my decisions. Did not the Malli-koï rule over <placeName>Tombouctou</placeName>? Certainly yes, replied the sheikh, he ruled over this city. - Wasn't there at that time a <roleName>câdi</roleName> in <placeName>Tombouctou</placeName>? - There was, Mahmoûd replied. - Are you better than this <roleName>câdi</roleName> or was this <roleName>câdi</roleName> better than you? He was better than me and more illustrious. - "Did this <roleName>câdi</roleName>," resumed the askia, "prevent the emperor of <placeName>Malli</placeName> from exercising his authority in <placeName>Tombouctou</placeName>?" -

"Are you better than that <roleName>câdi</roleName> or was that <roleName>câdi</roleName> better than you?" - "He was better than me," said the sheikh, "and was more illustrious." - ""Was not the shî then the ruler of <placeName>Timbuktu</placeName>?

"No, it was he who feared God more than I did and was superior to me." - "Did all these câdis prevent the rulers from exercising their authority in Toubouctou <ref/>, from executing or forbidding what they pleased, from levying taxes or contributions there?" - "They never prevented them from doing so and they never obstructed their wishes." "Well," said the askia, "why do you prevent me from acting and why do you obstruct me? Why, when I send messengers to carry out my instructions, do you push them away, hit them? why do you order them to be chased out of the city? what business is it of yours and why do you act in this way?"</p>

<p>
To these words, the sheikh (God have mercy on him!) replied:
"Have you forgotten or do you pretend to forget the day when you came to my house and took me by the foot and by my clothes and said to me: 'I have come to place myself under your protection and to entrust you with the responsibility of the people?
I have come to place myself under your protection and to entrust you help me and hold me by the hand so that I do not fall into hell.' This is the cause that made me chase your envoys and reject your orders." "I had forgotten it, by God! exclaimed the askia, but now it comes back to my memory and you are right. By God, you deserve to be rewarded, because you prevented a misfortune. May God keep you as a barrier between me and the fires of hell! I had irritated the Almighty, but I ask his forgiveness and I return to him. Even today I trust in you and cling to you. Keep your situation, may God maintain it for you, and protect me always!"</p>

<p>Then the askia kissed the hand of the sheikh, took leave of him, got back on his horse and returned to his steps happy and satisfied, making wishes for the sheikh to live long so that he himself could give up his soul to God before the sheikh (God have mercy on him!).</p>

<p><persName><roleName>The askia</roleName> Muhammad</persName> had been in power for two years and five months when the ninth century ended. It was during the last year of the century1 that he seized Diâga.2 Having taken 500 masons from that city, he took 400 of them to <placeName>Gâo</placeName> for his personal service, with all their instruments; these had, at that time, a chief called Karamogho. As for the other hundred masons, he gave them to his brother Amar-Komdiago. <ref/></p>

<p>
It is during the same year that Amar-Komdiâgo was invested of the dignity of kanfâri3; he was the first to carry this title, which did not exist before, whereas the titles of balamâ4 and Bengafarma existed since the time of the chî.</p>

<note n="1">The text literally bears "during this year"; this is probably the year with which the ixth century of the hegira ended, i.e., the year 900 (October 2, 1494 to September 28, 1495). The <title>Tarikh es-Sudan</title> places the capture of Diâga at the end of the year 899. - If Muhammad had indeed been reigning for two years and five months when the year 900 ended, it is appropriate to place his accession at the end of redjeb 898, i.e., around May 18
1493; this agrees quite well with the date assigned by the author to Muhammad's victory over Bâro (12 or 2 April 1493).</note>

<note n="3">The kanfâri was the first dignitary of the kingdom under the askia; his title seems to belong to the <rs type="ethnic">Mandingo language</rs>, in which it is said to mean "chief of the summit"; the author often gives the holder of the office of kanfâri the name of Kourmina-fâri, as the government of the Kourmina fell within the kanfâri's remit (see note 4, page 13).</note>

<p>In the course of the year 902 <ref target="1"/> [September 9, 1496 -August 29, 1497] the city of Tendirma was built2. The <persName><roleName>askia</roleName> Mohammed</persName> had indeed given the kanfâri orders to build for himself a capital. After searching, in accordance with the prince's advice, among the region of the islands3 and among the desert region, Amar arrived at Tendirma, whose location appealed to him. This place was formerly the home of a group of Jews4 whose tombs and wells are still found there today.
When the people of Amar's retinue saw these wells, of which there were then 333, both inside the city and in the vicinity, and when they saw the remarkable way in which these wells had been dug and laid out, they were filled with wonder.</p>

<p>The following was reported by one of our contemporaries living in <roleName>Môri</roleName>-Koïra, the môri Es-Sâdiq, son of the jurisconsult
<roleName>môri</roleName> (Mama) son of the jurisconsult <roleName>môri</roleName> Mâmaka son of the jurisconsult <roleName>môri</roleName> Haougâro.</p>

<p>He told us that he had heard his father, talking with people of his generation, tell that he had the following story from his grandfather. It was not on the order of the shî that the Jews had dug these wells nor because they had many herds, but because they cultivated vegetables from which they profited, the traders buying them for considerable sums, and because the water of these wells was better suited to their vegetables than the water of the River; he indeed who watered his vegetables with

the water of the River did not obtain products as sought after nor of as beautiful appearance as the one who watered them with the water of the wells: such was the cause for which they had dug these wells.</p>

<p>Some of these wells were 140 cubits deep, others were 200 cubits deep and some were only 60 to 100 cubits deep. Whenever the depth was less than 60 cubits, the water was not suitable for vegetables (<ref/>).</p>

<p>
At that time their city was so large that some of the inhabitants, when they wanted to go to wash their clothes, had to leave immediately after noon, taking with them their evening meal, and walk at a fast pace until sunset or almost until then, only then to reach the place where they could wash their clothes, while others had to walk only about twenty paces to go from the wall of their house to the edge of the water.1</p>

<p>
At that time seven princes reigned in the city, all of them descendants of the kings of the Jews, namely Jebroût ben Hichâm, Dzoulyemen ben Abdelhakim, <persName>Zeïr2 ben Salâm</persName>, Abdellatif ben Souleïmân, Mâlik ben Ayyoûb, Fadl ben Mizâr and Ghalib ben Yoûssof, Each of them had under his command a large army and each prince had wells determined for him and his troop. Whoever made a mistake and watered his vegetables with water from a well belonging to another prince than his own, had to compensate the prince who owned the well, whether the mistake was made by a free man or a slave. Each prince had 12,000 horsemen; as for the foot soldiers, that is, those who went on foot, they could not have been counted or enumerated.</p>

<note n="1">The author evidently means that the city extended from the water's edge to a distance of half a day's walk away from the River.</note>

<p>This is the way in which they dug wells. Immediately after drilling a well and removing the earth from it, they would mason the walls with clay and stones, then they would bring bundles of a wood such as teiber-teiber1 and arrange them in the middle of the well; then they would bring jars of bulanga2 and spread them over the whole, then they would set fire to it: the material would then melt, looking like cast iron3; the whole thing was then left to cool, and water was poured over it. Some of the ashes in the well were then removed, but some were left behind. The drilling of these wells required a considerable expense, but in the whole of the Tekroûr, there were no vegetables comparable to those of the city of which we have just spoken.
Such is the information which was reported to us.</p>

<p>However Amar had arrived in this place with the intention of building Tendirma. This city was so called because the kanfâri, at the moment of his arrival, found no one there except one <orgName>Sorko</orgName>, called Tendi, married to a woman (<ref/>) named Marma, and the names of these two individuals were joined together to form the name of the city, which is composed of Tendi and Marma4.</p>

<p>When Amar-Komdiago saw this <orgName>Sorko</orgName>, he asked him what had brought him there, and then he said to him: "What is your name and what tribe are you from?" The man answered him with these words:

<p>The account of his journey contains marvelous things which testify to our eyes of the favor with which God had showered this prince as well as the two jurisconsults (mentioned above), the alfa Sâlih Diawara and the alfa Mohammed Toulé.</p>

<p>
One day while he was walking accompanied by his retinue, he arrived at a vast oasis (<ref/>) situated between Alexandria and
<placeName>Cairo</placeName> and spent the night there with his troops. When midnight came, the alfa Sâlih Diawara, who had gone out alone to perform supererogatory prayers in a remote place, suddenly he heard a loud noise of voices; he went to the side of the voices and, when he was close to them, he saw lamps around which tâlebs belonging to the race of genies were reciting the Koran. Having gone around the group, he discovered that they were the companions of the genie Chamharoûch who were returning with him from the pilgrimage and that Chamharoûch was standing in the middle of them, while these tâlebs of the race of genies were turning towards him to recite the Koran. The alfa Sâlih Diawara went to the side of Chamharoûch and, when he arrived near him, he addressed him the Muslim greeting and shook his hand. All the group then began to return the greeting to the alfa and to shake his hand.</p>

<p>
The voices, having been raised on this occasion, were heard by the alfa Mohammed Toulé, who went out himself to make supererogatory prayers. Having recognized in the midst of the voices that of the alfa Sâlih Diawara, he feared that the latter had quarreled with someone from the suite of the <persName><roleName>askia</roleName> Mohammed</persName>, and he went to their side. When he arrived near them, he recognized the troop of the genius Chamharoûch

and the alfa Sâlih Diawara who, standing by Chamharoûch, was addressing questions to him. He then came forward and greeted Chamharoûch and his companions and sat down to talk with them.</p>

<p>
While they were talking, Moûssa, son of the alfa Sâlih Diawara, came out in his turn; he was then a child of six years. He heard his father's voice and went to the side from which it came. Arriving near the group, he recognized his father and the alfa Mohammed Toulé in the middle of the genies who formed the escort of the genie Chamharoûch and he sat down near his father.</p>

<p>
At this moment Chamharoûch, addressing the two jurisconsults, said to them: "Who are you? - We are, they answered, people of the entourage of the prince of the Believers, the askia Mohammed; he left his home to accomplish the pilgrimage and we accompanied him for the same purpose. Chamharoûch then congratulated (Sâlih) Diawara and said, "The <persName><roleName>askia Mohammed</roleName></persName> is a holy man. I heard from the Prophet (God shower his blessings on him and grant him salvation!) that there would be twelve Khalifs, all of them from <rs type="ethnic">Qoreish</rs>, and I think that the <persName><roleName>askia</roleName> Muhammad</persName> is one of them.
Ten of them have already lived, there are still two to come and probably he is the eleventh; when the last one, will come during the 13th century [of the Hegira]1. The Prophet
(blessings and salvation be upon him!) told me that I would live until the ninth century, that I would be the contemporary of the eleventh Khalifa, who would be the judge between genies and men, and that I should expect to die then. -

(<ref/>) and grant him salvation!)? they asked him.
- "Yes," he replied, "and I have received his teachings." This good news filled the jurisconsults with joy.</p>

<p>
In the meantime, a slave genius appeared before them and said: "One of your shepherds hit one of our young servants to the point that he lost consciousness, and therefore we appeal to the law against you. How, exclaimed the jurisconsult alfa Sâlih Diawara, would one of our shepherds have hit one of your servants, while you are invisible to us? -- "The young servant," replied the slave, "had taken the form of a serpent. But then Chamharoûch, chief of the geniuses, spoke and said: "The blood of one who has left his primitive form to metamorphose cannot be avenged".</p>

<p>
Thereupon the jurisconsults rose, took leave of the genies and went to join their fellow travelers.</p>

<p>
The caravan had spent two nights in this place when one of its members named Mohammed, koî-idié of Songaï1, who had belonged to the entourage of the shî and had committed many iniquities, died. When they got into line to make the prayer on the deceased, Moûssa, son of the alfa Sâlih,
was standing, among the crowd, and the divine favor of which he was the object was manifested to our eyes. As he was near his father, he said to him: "O my father, behold, the angels are taking away the deceased from among us, so that only an empty stretcher remains in our hands! Now no one had seen this but him, and his father began to say to him, "Be quiet, O my little child!" Thus it was found that, from a young age, he had the gift of second sight.</p>

<note n="1">That is, "prince of a royal family of Songai"; the term koï-idié

<p>
As for the alfa Sâlih Diawara, this is how the divine favor of which he was the object was manifested to us. We had left the place mentioned above and had been travelling forcibly for three days, when, on the third day, a wind began to blow so hot and violent that, in the whole caravan, only those whose faith was strong retained the hope of escaping death. All the water in the skins dried up, so that not a drop remained. The thirst having become so great for everyone that they suffered more than the wind, the skins were opened, but nothing was found, which increased the general despair.</p>

The troop having been obliged to halt because of the violence of the wind, the <persName><roleName>askia</roleName> Mohammed</persName>, prince of the believers, gave orders to one of his servants named Fara Diallo to go and find this scholar, i.e., the alfa Sâlih Diawara, and to ask him to address an invocation to God in the sacred name of the Prophet (God shower his blessings on him and grant him salvation! ), so that he would provide us with water.

And immediately rising to his feet, he turned to the side of <placeName>Mecca</placeName> and cried out, "O my God, we are overwhelmed by thirst and you know my situation better than we do, since you know what is hidden as well as what is apparent." His words were not finished when we heard the thunder and at the same time the rain began to fall on us. We quenched our thirst, watered our beasts of burden, washed ourselves and our clothes, and we remained two days in this place, where the water had formed a river the width of a hundred spears.</p>

However the prince <persName><roleName>askia</roleName> Mohammed</persName> had distributed dates to the people of the caravan according to his habit. He gave some to everyone, but forgot the alfa Mohammed Toulé. The latter felt a great deal of sorrow in his heart, but he did not show it to anyone. Some members of the caravan imagined that this exception was premeditated, while the others said that it was only an oversight; as for the people of the tent of the alfa Mohammed Toulé, they began to weep, and some murmured against the <persName><roleName>askia</roleName> Mohammed</persName>. While these various feelings were agitating the caravan, behold, a white camel was seen coming from the east and carrying a considerable load of dates; it split the crowd as it made its way towards the tent of the alfa Mohammed Toulé, and then, when it reached there, dropped the load of dates at the feet of the alfa and returned in the direction from which it had come. Then the alfa Mohammed Toulé got up, approached the load and had the dates distributed

<pb n="131"/>
 among all the people of the caravan as the <persName><roleName>askia</roleName> Mohammed</persName> had done, and then he had a share given to the prince askia. Now it turned out that never had anyone seen dates like these. While we followed the camel with our eyes until it had disappeared from our view, the prince askia Mohammed came and bowed to the alfa, kissing his hands and feet and apologizing for his forgetfulness. This is how the divine favor of this scholar, this saint, was manifested to all that day, when he said to the prince: "You had forgotten me because the servant is prone to forget, but the Master never forgets anyone".</p>

 <p>
It was at the end of the year 903 (1498 CE) that [the <persName><roleName>askia</roleName> Muhammad</persName>] returned (from <placeName>Mecca</placeName>).</p>

<p>
Among other singularities and wonderful events that occurred during his pilgrimage, [we may mention] the following facts. The inhabitants of the two noble and sacred cities2 : They came to meet him; he bought a site in the glorious city of <placeName>Mecca</placeName> on which he built an inaison and he constituted it as a habous in favor of the noble temple of the Ka'ba; There he had interviews with illustrious doctors and pious and revered personages; 'the sheriff of <placeName>Mecca</placeName> conferred upon him the turban3 and conferred upon him the investiture of sovereignty by placing upon his head a blue turban and giving him the title of Imâm.</p>

<p>
In <placeName>Cairo</placeName>, he met Sidi Abderrahmân Es-Soyoûti, who announced to him the events that would take place in his country. As the askia asked him about the city of
<placeName>Gâo</placeName> and the future reserved for this city, it is claimed that he replied, "I fear that seditions will be the cause of its loss." Asked next about the city of <placeName>Tombouctou</placeName>,
-

he is reported to have (<ref/>) said, "The greatest danger I fear for its inhabitants is that the city will be ruined and annihilated by famine." Then, speaking of the city of <placeName>Dienné</placeName>, he said that it would be destroyed and its inhabitants would perish as a result of a sudden invasion of waters, which would submerge them all. And he told the askia other wonderful things.
The scholar, the very learned Sidi Mohammed ben Abdelkerîm1 also came to visit the askia.</p>

<p>
This prince, it is said, had learned that an inhabitant of Mecca possessed some hairs from the head of the Envoy of God (God shower his blessings on him and grant him salvation!) and that traders came to this man with heaps of gold, asking him to soak these noble and blessed hairs in water, in order to drink this water afterwards and to use it for their ablutions. He went to the man himself and asked him to show him the hair, and as the man showed it to him, he took one of them, put it in his mouth and swallowed it. Ah! what a clever and profitable maneuver! what a heavenly and abundant favor!</p>

<p>
It is said that the askia entered the wired enclosure surrounding the tomb of the Envoy of God (God shower his blessings on him and grant him salvation!) and that the Bara-koï, the mansa Koûra, who had entered with him, seized one of the columns of this noble enclosure and exclaimed: "O askia Mohammed, here is the Envoy of God
(God bless him and grant him salvation!); here are Aboubekr and Omar (God be pleased with them!): I place myself under their sacred aegis, and I will ask you for several things: The first is that you bring my daughters into your palace only as legitimate wives. -
<note n="1">This is El-Megbîli; see note 2, page 15.</note> 
<milestone unit="scannumber" n="161"/>
<pb n="133"/>

That is understood, replied the askia; and what is the second? - 'It is,' replied the Bara-koï, 'that you stop where I stop you, when you order or forbid something.' - That's a given; and what is the third? - That you never put to death anyone who takes refuge in my house or places himself under my protection. That's an agreed thing. It is absolutely necessary, continued the Bara-koï, that you take a firm commitment on this subject in this holy place and that the Envoy of God (God pours his blessings on him and grants him salvation!) be the witness of it. - "It is understood," said the askia, and the pact was thus concluded.</p>

<p> It is reported that when the askia was surrounded by the inhabitants of <placeName>Bergo</placeName>1, who had routed his army, he
was followed by his sons, who numbered exactly one hundred. The troops of the king of <placeName>Bergo</placeName> had surrounded them and separated them from the rest of the army, so that he found himself alone with his children. Then dismounting, the askia offered a prayer of two rik'a2, and then, turning to the side of <placeName>Mecca</placeName>, he cried out, "O my God, I implore thee in remembrance of that day when I stood beside the head of thy Envoy in his mausoleum (<ref/>) and I asked you to help me in all the difficulties that I would experience; I beg you, O my God, to help me and my children and to make us escape safely from the hands of these people." Then, getting back on his horse, he said to his children: "Group yourselves before me, so that

This is presumably the country of <placeName>Bergo</placeName> or Borgou, inhabited by the <placeName>Bariba</placeName> and located southwest of Dendi, in the north of our present colony of Dahomey. Mention of this expedition, which is also related in the <title>Tarikh es-Soudân</title> (see translation, page 125), will be found later.</note>

<note n="2">A rik'a is a set of formulas and gestures whose repetition, regulated according to the hours of the day, constitutes the canonical prayer of Muslims.</note>

I may help  you depart out of here". - 'We will never do that,' they replied, 'for we are many, and if some of us die, there will be others left, while you are one, and if you die, we will have no father to take your place.' Then his children placed him in their midst, and they charged at the enemy, routing them and escaping unharmed, without any of them being hurt.</p>

<p>
After having thus crossed the circle of investment and having joined his troops, the askia said to them: "Listen and, so marvellous is this thing which did not happen to any human being before me, know, without that it should however surprise you, that God gave me one hundred children of whom none is capable of cowardice nor of defection and who are all valiant horsemen. For it sometimes happens that men whom God has given birth to live without having a single child or have only one who is a perverse and ungrateful child, whereas God has given me a hundred children endowed with all virtues, for which I am very grateful."</p>

<p>
Among the miracles attributed to the <persName><roleName>askia</roleName> Muhammad</persName> is the following. When he arrived in the capital of Môssi-koï after decimating his army and routing it, he stopped by a tree which was in that place and at the foot of which was the idol of the country people; he made a gesture in the direction of the idol and immediately, thanks to the divine intervention, the tree rose out of the ground and fell to the ground.
When asked what words he had spoken to the tree and what he had done to it to cause it to fall, he replied: "By God, I did nothing but pronounce the formula 'there is no

The askia made this expedition2 during the year 904 [August 19, 1498-August 7, 1499]. It was in this year that our master the jurisconsult Mahmoûd ben Omar was invested with the functions of <roleName>câdi</roleName>.</p>

cows and slaves: "We must," the others distributed, "have our share of this present as partners and we will divide it among ourselves in equal fractions. When the first refused, a very lively discussion broke out among them.
Things came to such a point that the first three, accompanied by their brothers, returned to the askia Mohammed, to whom they told what had just happened between them and themselves.</p>

<p>
The prince welcomed them smiling, full of joy and satisfaction, and said to the brothers, "When I made this gift, I did not have in view all the descendants of the <roleName>môri</roleName> Haougâro, and I was only thinking of the three of you who were then present. What I have given them is the share which God had devolved upon them beforehand: therefore it belongs to them in full ownership, since it is God who has allotted it to them."
Then he gave the other brothers ten slaves and a hundred cows and said, "This is yours personally." Then he gave the other brothers ten slaves and a hundred cows and said, "This is yours personally, and you will all be entitled to claim the same compensation from me every year as long as I live." After receiving this gift, they showed their gratitude to the prince and prayed to God that the askia would live long and enjoy his empire in peace.</p>

Then they said to him: "We beg you to give us a safe-conduct in writing, so that we may travel to all the cities without our interests being harmed and without being exposed to the risk that one of your soldiers, using us with malice, may molest us and rob us. May God keep you from the fire of hell!" The prince welcomed their request and ordered his secretary to write down what he was going to dictate to him.</p>

But, following a trial judged at the hearing of <roleName>câdi</roleName> Abderrahmân, the jurisconsult <roleName>câdi</roleName> Mahmoûd, having learned of the decision rendered in the circumstance by Abderrahmân (<ref/>), sent him someone to advise him to reform his judgment, which was contrary to the texts of the Qur'an, Sunnah, and Idjmâ'. Abderrahmân refused to do so and wanted to maintain the execution of his sentence. The sheikh made no comment, but the askia Mohammed, having been informed of the matter, dispatched envoys to revoke Abderrahmân and have him hand over the judicial functions to the <roleName>câdi</roleName> Mahmoûd.</p>

<p>
Arriving at <placeName>Tombouctou</placeName>, the prince's messenger assembled the ulama and jurisconsults of that city in the mosque of Sidi Yahya and the <roleName>câdi</roleName> Abderrahmân, summoned by order of the askia, went to the meeting. The royal envoy then said to him, "The askia orders you to hand over your duties immediately to <roleName>câdi</roleName> Mahmoûd, for you are only his deputy, and, when the deputized official is present, the deputization ceases and is cancelled. Moreover, as long as Mahmud is alive among us, you cannot occupy the post of <roleName>câdi</roleName>." Then he strongly reproached him for the lack of tact he had shown in not immediately resigning his powers upon the return of the <roleName>câdi</roleName> Mahmoûd. Then, after removing him, the prince's envoys went to the <roleName>câdi</roleName> Mahmoûd and enjoined him, in the name of the askia, to resume his title and exercise the functions of it.
But the latter energetically refused to do so, despite the insistence to which he was subjected.</p>

<p>
As soon as the askia was aware of his categorical refusal, he sent him the notables of his entourage to force him to accept. Mahmoûd consented to it only defeated by

It was in the year 918 [March 19, 1512 - March 8, 1513] that the impostor was killed, i.e. Téniedda, who claimed to be a prophet and envoy of God (the divine curse be upon him!). It was the kanfâri Amar-Komdiâgo who killed him, without the askia having given him the order and without this prince having known about it; starting from Tendirma, Amar marched against Téniedda and God granted him the victory: given that his adversary had more numerous, stronger and more determined troops than his own, the kanfâri Amar could only manage to defeat him thanks to the divine protection.</p>

<p>
This Téniedda was chief of the <orgName>Foûta</orgName> called <orgName>Foûta-Kingui</orgName>3; he was a powerful, valiant, brave prince, gifted with energy and inclined to revolt. Having left the kingdom of <placeName>Foûta</placeName>, he had come to <placeName>Kingui</placeName> (<ref/>), settled there and had himself proclaimed king.

Amar, this is it: there had arisen between the Kaniriga-faren1 and Téniedda, king of the <placeName>Foûta</placeName>, quarrels, frictions and rivalries of such a nature that the latter had sworn to ruin the capital of his adversary and to make a desert of it; and, as Téniedda had superior forces in men and horses, the Raniaga-faren appealed to the help of the kanfâri Amar, and for this reason the latter made his expedition.</p>

<p>This is at least the first version we heard of this affair. But later, a person well informed about these events told me that the reason kanfâri Amar had made an expedition against Téniedda was that a <orgName>Zaghrâni</orgName> living in Songaï went every year to the
<placeName>Foûta</placeName> to trade there and that Téniedda, having heard of this man, seized his person, violently and unjustly stripped him of his goods and wanted to put him to death. The <orgName>Zaghrâni</orgName>, having succeeded in escaping, fled to the Kourmina-fâri Amar and tried to harm Téniedda in his mind by slandering him and insinuating that he spoke with contempt of the kanfâri. These words made an impression on the latter, who became violently angry and began his expedition against Téniedda).</p>

<p>
The Songai people were already well versed in the art of war and the science of combat; they were very brave, very bold and very expert in the tricks of war.
Observe, for example, how, at the head of a numerous army, the Kurmina-fâri succeeded in crossing those immense waterless deserts which extend over the distance of more than two months' march, separating Tendirma from the <placeName>Foûta</placeName>, and how he was afterwards able to win the victory, seize the

 country, put his opponent to death, and collected enormous booty, all during the year 918. Amar cut off Teniedda's head and brought it back to Tendirma, where it was buried.</p>

It was on the day of his disembarkation at <placeName>Gâo</placeName> that he learned of the illness of his brother, the Kourmina-fâri (<foreign></foreign>) Amar-Komdiâgo. He then retraced his steps and went incognito to Tendirma, where he arrived at night, and that same night Amar died and was buried in his palace. The askia stayed there for three days. It is said that on one of those days he rode his horse along the small branch of the river to the place where it ends at Lake Fati3 and that on his way back he exclaimed: "How beautiful and magnificent this country is! Unfortunately, one never finds two people who agree on the same point."
When asked the reason for this, he said: "It is because the river that waters it has a tortuous course; consequently, those who drink its water do not have a firm word and its residents do not agree among themselves." He then returned
to <placeName>Gâo</placeName>. His journey there and back had lasted twelve days, without any of the inhabitants of <placeName>Gâo</placeName> having known of his absence until they saw him return.</p>

about the latter: some claim that he was the son of a woman of the askia and therefore his son-in-law, others assure that he was his uterine brother, others finally say that he was the son of the brother of Kassaï, daughter of the Koura-koï1 Boukar and mother of the askia. The above-mentioned Kanfâri Yâya remained in power for nine years.</p>
<p>At the end of this period2, the Kourmina-fâri Yâya left his residence to go to <placeName>Gâo</placeName>, learning that the askia Moûssacher was taking advantage of the fact that the sight of his father was weakening to depose him. Thus leaving Tendirma with the aim of preventing this maneuver, if necessary by force, Yaya arrived at <placeName>Gâo</placeName> and addressed observations to
Moûssa and his followers, but they would not listen and persisted in their seditious plans. One day when Yâya had gone out to ride on horseback in the vicinity of the city of <placeName>Gâo</placeName>, the askia Moûssa also mounted a horse in the company of his brothers who were friends of disorder, unrest and revolt, and, having followed Yâya on the trail, they joined him at a place called Râs-Arizour (Arizour meaning "the flowing of the water4").
